In "prog.txt" you can do two things. Change the memory address, and change what is at that address. 

All values are in hex.
To change the memory address, type 'm' and then the address in hex.
To change the value at the address, type the value. It will automatically update the address in the next line.
End each line with a semicolon. You can also add comments after a semicolon.
