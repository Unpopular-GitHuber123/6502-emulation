Hello people

This is a collection of a few CPUs I decided to emulate (in C), including my own design! (Note: only one (6502) is in the repository right now. Ignore the folder "custom".)

The documentation for each one can be found linked or as its own file in each folder.

Look at the example program in each folder for information on how to set up the file (once installed and included) and write a program.

I'm ass at writing readmes so this is all you get k thx bye
