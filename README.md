Hello people

This is a collection of a few CPUs I decided to emulate (in C), including my own design! (Note: only one (6502) is in the repository right now. Ignore the folder "custom".)

The documentation for each one can be found linked or as its own file in each folder.

Look at the example program in each folder for information on how to set up the file (once installed and included) and write a program.

As for the license, I'm pretty sure the MIT one means do whatever you want so use that license ig (Legal disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer. Do not take this summary for legal advice.)

There might be some binary files in the folders in some commits. This is because of the way I have my compiler set up, so just delete those.

I'm ass at writing readmes so this is all you get k thx bye
